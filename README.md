## Flood mapping of Duhok District and potential impacts of the floods to the households of displacementaffected population groups
# Floods in Iraq after heavy rainfalls


On 19 March 2024, heavy rainfalls swept through and caused flesh floods in Iraq, especially the mountainous Kurdistan Region in northern Iraq. Duhokâ€™s Civil Defense Directorate reported that 2 people were killed by their submerged vehicle. Here presented a remote sensing task for the assessment of flooded area in Duhok District. Google Earth Engine was used to perform flood mapping as to show which region was mostly affected by the floods. With the dataset from REACH Iraq IRQ2308 Cross-Cutting Needs Assessment (CCNA), the HH-level Dataset in the most affected region was processed and analysed by using R software.

# Methodology
This flood mapping was based on the best practices recommended by UN-SPIDER. After obtaining images from before and after, speckle filter was applied to eliminate the noise in radar data. Masks were also used to remove permanent water, isolated pixels and steep areas in order the obtain flood with large area. Flood area was then calculated. The dataset from REACH Iraq IRQ2308 CCNA was used to estimate the substantial impacts of the flood to the households (HHs) of displacement-affected population groups, as to address their immediate need.Flooded area

The total area of Duhok District is 98704.5 hectare.  The Flooded area is 1.3 hectare. It was found that the most affected region is Duhok City, the capital city of Duhok District. The red area of the bottom left in Figure 2a. showed that Duhok City had more flood than other regions after the heavy rainfalls on 19 March 2024
